            <h3> Introduce the importance of personal health & hygiene</h3>
            <p>There is direct correlation between poor personal hygiene and illness.For this reason ,it is critical
                that textile<br>
                workers and other personnel understand and practice good basic hygiene habits,includng proper
                handwashing<br>
                on a regular basis. The FDA white paper (FDA 1999)cited poor personal hygiene and improper washing
                as<br>
                the third most important cause of illness. This report also cited that 93% of outbreaks related to
                textile handlers<br>
                involed sick workers.Problems associated with these otbreaks included poor peronal hygiene,poor<br>
                handwasing.OPen sores,improper glove use,and eating while on the job

            <p>Textile workers are exposed to airbone particulate from natural and synthetic fibrous material in their
                work<br>
                environment.Exposure to cotton dust in the textile industry gas been associated with sevaral
                work-specific and<br>
                non-specific respiratory symptoms. Cotton dust is offten contaminated with Gram-negative
                bacteria,which<br>
                contain endotoxis(lipopolysaccharide) in the outer cell wall. Some studies suggested that endotoxis
                is<br>
                probably a major causative agent in the adverse pulmonary effects associated with organic dust
                exposure<br>
                Endotoxis occurs abundantly in organic dust contaminated with animal faces and plant materials.
                Endotoxis is<br>
                released into the air during cotton processing.Exposure to cotton dust and endotoxis has been implicated
                in the<br>
                aetiology of a number of diseases,incuding byssinosis,chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive
                pulmonary<br>
                disaese along with nasal and occlar irritation </p>

            <h3>Introduce the importance of personal health & hygiene</h3>
            <p style="color: #747474;">In some activities such as carding and willwing ,workers may be exposed to
                biological agents such as
                anthrax,<br>
                clostridium tetani(the causative agents of tetanus), and coxilla burnetti(which causes Q fever).
                Exposure to<br>
                biologicala agents can result in allergies and respiratory disorders</p>
